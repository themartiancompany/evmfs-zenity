# Ethereum Virtual Machine File System (EVMFS) File Downloader

![evmfs-get-zenity](media/evmfs-get-zenity.jpg)

A super simple
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
file download graphical interface written
in Bash with
[Zenity](
  https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/zenity).

It depends on the
[Crash Bash](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/crash-bash)
library and on the reference EVMFS implementation.

## Installation

The program in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

It has been officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`evmfs-zenity`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  evmfs-zenity
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[evmfs-zenity-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs-zenity-ur).

Be aware the mirror could go offline any time as Github and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.
